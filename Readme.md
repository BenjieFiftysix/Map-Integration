# Map integration

I have created two examples of how the map could be integrated:

### Full page with "Return to Website" button:
[*Example*](https://benjiefiftysix.github.io/integration/FullPage/index.html)

To use this one, Download the folder "FullPage" to somewhere in the website. You can then rename and link to the folder.
All files required for the map are stored in that folder, apart from `markers.js`, which it will get from benjiefiftysix.github.io, which allows me to update the markers using my script, without requiring access to the server.


### Map with website navigation bar:
[*Example*](https://benjiefiftysix.github.io/integration/WithTitleBar/index.html)
Note: The styles for the navigation bar in the example don't seem to work. Just imagine it looks like the navigation bar in the rest of the gcop.scot website.

To use this one, you can use an Iframe, which allows you to display the map from [benjiefiftysix.github.io](https://benjiefiftysix.github.io/) inside your website.
To add it to a page, add the code `<iframe src="https://benjiefiftysix.github.io/">` into the html. I am not farmiliar with wordpress, and don't know how to make it the correct size.
